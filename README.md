# node-todo
A Single Page Todo App in Node and Angular

## Background 
This is a very simple Todo application using the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack. I'm creating: 
> Single page application to create and finish todos
> Storing todos in a MongoDB using Mongoose
> Using the Express framework
> Creating a RESTful Node API
> Using Angular for the frontend and to access the API
